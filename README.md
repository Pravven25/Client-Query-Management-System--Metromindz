The Client Query Management System is a web-based application developed using Python, Streamlit, and MySQL to help organizations manage client queries in a simple and organized way. This system allows clients to register, log in, and submit their issues through an easy-to-use interface, while the support team can log in separately to view, track, assign, and update the status of all queries. Each query is stored securely in a MySQL database and can be marked as Open, In Progress, or Resolved based on the support team’s actions. The application also includes a dashboard with tables and charts to show query status and trends, making it easy to understand workload and performance. This project demonstrates real-world concepts such as role-based access, database connectivity, CRUD operations, and data visualization, and is suitable for beginner to intermediate level learners.
